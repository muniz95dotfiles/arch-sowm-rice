# README

So I was fiddling around with [sowm](https://github.com/dylanaraps/sowm) to get autofocus on mouse hover working (which was quite easy) and COVID-19 has blessed me with some more free time so I decided to try my hand at some XLib programming in C as well.

The code in the screenshot is me trying to reimplement sowm using tinywm as a starting point.
